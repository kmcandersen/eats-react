# EATS BY THE 'L'

Select a CTA rail station using the search box or by clicking on the map, and this app displays restaurant recommendations from Yelp, located within a half-mile of the station.

The app is built with the [Yelp Fusion API](https://www.yelp.com/fusion), the [ArcGIS API for JavaScript](https://developers.arcgis.com/javascript/), and React, using the [Calcite Web](https://esri.github.io/calcite-web/) and [Material-UI](https://material-ui.com/) frameworks.

An initial version is deployed at [eats.netlify.app](https://eats.netlify.app/).
